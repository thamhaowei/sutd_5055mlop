I sat for the GCE A-Level examination in 2024 or earlier. Will I be allowed to use H2 KI as one of my H2 content-based subjects in the UAS computation when I apply to SUTD in AY2026 or later?

Applicants who had sat for the GCE A-Level examinations in 2024 or earlier and offered H2 Knowledge & Inquiry (KI) in lieu of H1 General Paper (GP)
will not
be allowed to use H2 KI as a H2 content-based subject in the UAS computation as the H2 KI grade will be required to fulfil the H1 GP requirement under the revised UAS computation.
--------------
If I sat for the GCE A-Level examinations in 2024 or earlier, will I lose out to my peers with the revised UAS computation method when applying to SUTD?

Admission to SUTD is based on open competition and merit. SUTD assesses applicants holistically, taking into consideration both academic and non-academic aspects.
--------------
I sat for the GCE A-Level examinations in 2024 or earlier. How will my UAS be computed if I apply for admission to SUTD in AY2026 or later?

For admission in AY2026 and AY2027
For applicants who sat for the GCE A-Level examination in 2024 or earlier, their PW, as well as H1 and H2 content-based subject grades will be taken into consideration for UAS computation, as per current practice. Applicants who offered H2 KI can use it in lieu of H1 GP and the H1 content-based subject in UAS computation. Their UAS will be computed on the existing 90-point scale and proportionately weighted to the revised 70-point scale.
For admissions from AY2028
Regardless of the year of GCE A-Level examination, applicants’ UAS will be computed using the revised 70-point scale.
The PW grade will not be considered in the UAS computation from AY2028. An applicant would be considered to have met the requirement for admission if he/she presents a Pass grade in PW. If an applicant had previously offered H2 Knowledge & Inquiry (KI) in lieu of H1 General Paper (GP), the H2 KI grade will be considered as the H1 GP grade in the revised UAS computation from AY2028.
--------------
Can I choose the method to compute my UAS (based on current or revised A-Level curriculum)?

The method to compute UAS will depend on the year the applicant sat for the GCE A-Level examinations and the year of application. Applicants will not be able to select the UAS computation method.
--------------
I am a private candidate/I have been exempted from PW. Do I need to offer PW to gain entry into SUTD?

Private candidates or students who have been exempted from PW are not subject to the requirement to have a Pass in PW.
--------------
Will I be eligible for SUTD admission if I fail Project Work (PW)?

From AY2026,
all applicants presenting local GCE A-Level qualifications will need to present a Pass grade in PW to be eligible for admission.
From the 2024 JC1/PU2 cohort, should a student fail PW but is promoted to JC2/PU3, the junior college/Millennia Institute (JC/MI) will assess on a case-by-case basis whether to offer the option to re-take PW in JC2/PU3.
Students who fail PW and are also not promoted to JC2/PU3, will have to offer PW again.
--------------
Do I need to offer a contrasting subject? Will the contrasting subject be considered in the UAS?

Yes, there is no change to the contrasting subject requirement at the GCE A-Level examinations. Students will be required to offer four content-based A-Level subjects of which at least three must be H2 subjects, and at least one must be a contrasting subject from outside their area of specialisation (i.e., subject from the Mathematics & Science domain for students in the Arts stream, and subject from the Humanities & Arts domain for students in the Science stream) that may be offered at either H1 or H2.
From AY2026 AU admissions,
the fourth H1/H2 content-based subject (which may be a contrasting subject) will only be included in the computation of UAS if it improves the score for students who sat for the GCE A-Level examinations in 2025 and after.

I’m an international student. Am I required to apply for a Student Pass and when can I do so?

You will need to submit STP application to the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) as soon as possible upon receiving the registration details from SUTD via email.

How much does it cost to stay on campus?

More information on
housing fees and stay periods can be found at the Housing webpages
.
--------------
How are students assigned to their rooms? What if I am not comfortable with my assigned roommate?

Freshmore students are paired in double rooms according to the class/cluster they are assigned to. Students complete a lifestyle questionnaire as part of the housing acceptance process, and will be matched with roommates of similar lifestyle habits as far as possible.
As both you and your roommate embark on your university journey, with time you will discover each other’s interests, strengths and quirks, as well as how to support and cheer each other on in this new environment. Do approach the Office of Housing at
ecchousing@sutd.edu.sg
should you need our help to resolve any differences.
--------------
Is it compulsory to stay in the student hostel? Is there a curfew?

Yes, Freshmores are required to reside at the hostel during Terms 1 and 2 including those who live near the campus, as residential living is an integrated part of the SUTD Freshmore experience, complementing the cohort-based learning in and out of classrooms.
While there is no curfew and students are free to return home or go out to attend to personal matters, students are expected to observe stipulated quiet hours to minimise disturbance to fellow residents.

Physics or Chemistry, though students with other subject combinations will also be considered. We will also take into consideration your grades at IBDP Year 4, O-level or equivalent.

There are various alternative pathways for you to consider, including:
Retaking your A-Levels; or
Further your studies via the polytechnics, which offer module exemptions of up to two semesters for A-Level graduates in selected courses. These module exemptions allow A-Level graduates to graduate with a polytechnic diploma within 2 or 2.5 years, compared to the usual 3 years. More information on the application process and courses on offer can be found on the respective polytechnics’ websites
