Ease into your new journey with a grade-free system
All subjects in Term 1 are grade-free, so you’ll only receive a “Pass” or “No Record” grade for each one. You can also select up to four more subjects from Terms 2 and 3 to be grade-free. This lets you adjust to academic life at SUTD, explore new interests, or dive into unfamiliar subjects—without having to worry over grades.
