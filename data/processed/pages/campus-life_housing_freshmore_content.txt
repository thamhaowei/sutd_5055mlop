From Academic Year 2026, Freshmore undergraduates are required to reside at student housing on campus during Terms 1 to 3. Designed as an integrated part of the Freshmore experience, residential living complements cohort-based learning in and out of classrooms and aims to foster a sense of community and ownership, building strong friendships that carry through the undergraduate years and beyond.
Freshmore students who would like to stay on after Term 3 may apply for housing together with other undergraduates during scheduled housing application windows, typically in February each year. Information on the housing application window will be published on the
Undergraduate housing page
by early February. Housing allocation will be guided by the Undergraduate Housing Allocation Scheme. More information on the scheme will be shared with incoming Freshmores after the start of the September term.
