Residents’ safety and welfare
SUTD reviews its security measures periodically to ensure the safety and well-being of our hostel residents, and has strengthened its security measures at the hostel over the years. This includes a 24/7 on-site security team, regular security patrols, monitoring of CCTVs (closed circuit television) and controlled access to blocks, common facilities and bathrooms. Residents are also regularly reminded on issues regarding their personal safety and security.
In addition, live-in staff and hostel student leaders play an important role in the education, outreach and engagement of student residents. Together, they help to foster a culture of care and respect within the hostel community. By bringing residents’ concerns to various teams at the University, their presence helps the University to have a better appreciation of the issues of importance to residents. Resident students are also able to reach out to them easily if they are in need of assistance.
Room type: Double Room
Freshmore students are paired in double rooms according to the class/cluster they are assigned to. Students complete a lifestyle questionnaire as part of the housing acceptance process, and will be matched with roommates of similar lifestyle habits as far as possible.
