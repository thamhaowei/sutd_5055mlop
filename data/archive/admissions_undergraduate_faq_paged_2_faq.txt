--------------
I have obtained a loan under the CPF Education Loan Scheme (CPFELS) to finance my tuition fee payable but I have yet to receive a bill for my tuition fee. Why?

Tuition and related fees are billed at the start of the term.
If you have applied for CPF Education Loan Scheme for settlement of tuition fees, please note that the CPF withdrawn amount will only be reflected in your statement of account after Week 3 of the term after due processing.
The amount of funds withdrawn from CPF account is subject to available and eligible funds for withdrawal by CPF Board.
--------------
How do I check the balance in / withdraw funds from my Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA)?

You can check your PSEA balance by contacting MOE at 6260 0777 or
contact@moe.gov.sg
.
Funds can be withdrawn from your PSEA either by submitting a Standing Order application or an Adhoc Withdrawal application. Please refer to
the PSEA page
for details on the withdrawal process.
--------------
What can I use the Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) funds for? If I have applied for and been awarded Tuition Fee Loan (TFL) and/or Study Loan (SL), can I still use my PSEA funds?

You may use your own or your siblings’ PSEA funds to pay for tuition fees, compulsory miscellaneous fees and hostel fees (for Freshmore terms where the hostel stay is compulsory). PSEA funds can also be used for enrichment programmes such as overseas student programmes and local and overseas conferences/competitions approved and endorsed by the University. The withdrawal limit is up to the PSEA balance.
For more information and application, please refer to the
PSEA page
.
For enquiries, please write to:
psea@sutd.edu.sg
.
If you have been awarded the TFL and/or SL, the PSEA funds will be used first to offset your tuition fees and compulsory miscellaneous fees. The TFL and SL will then be applied to clear any outstanding tuition fees after deducting your PSEA funds.

What is the admission process?

You will generally be notified by end April if you’re selected for a conversation with our faculty/leader.
All applicants will receive an email notification of your admission (and scholarship, if applicable) outcome latest by mid-May. For more information, please refer to the
application timeline and process
.
--------------
How do I appeal against the admissions decision?

Please refer to the timeline and process outlined in the appeal section of the
application process here
.
Your appeal must represent significant and compelling new academic and/or personal information that was not present at the time of application and which brings merit for reconsideration.
Only applicants who have submitted an application in the current admissions exercise, and have received outcomes of your application may submit an appeal. Appeals can only be submitted
here
after logging into the
SUTD Admissions System
. Appeals via any other channels will not be considered.
--------------
Are testimonials compulsory?

Applicants will have to either upload one testimonial/recommendation letter or input the referee’s details and email address in the online application form. Your referee(s) should ideally be someone who knows you well (at least 6 months in recent years) and can attest to your character and academic ability, e.g. your principal or high school teacher (preferably teaching Maths/Science), or someone who knows you professionally, e.g. an internship or work supervisor.
--------------
I had not been successful in my application to SUTD in the last admissions exercise. Can I apply again this year with the same results?

You will not be penalised for re-applying in the new admissions exercise and your new application will be assessed in competition with the pool of applicants applying this time round. However, we do recommend that you consider supplementing your new application with additional relevant information not presented previously to improve your chances of being considered for admission.
--------------
What can I expect during the conversation with SUTD faculty/leader? How important is this in determining my chance of securing an admission placement?

The conversation with our faculty/leader is an important one as it will provide you with the opportunity to ask any questions you may have about SUTD. It will also help us to understand your motivation for applying to the University, get to know you better and discuss whether SUTD is a good fit for you. If you are selected for our Special Programmes, you will be invited for a special selection exercise which also includes a conversation with our faculty/leader. You will be notified of the details via email once you are selected.
For scholarships, we will be looking out for outstanding achievements in both your academic and co-curricular activities, as well as your service and desire to help the community – which may set you apart from the competition.
Based on the conversation as well as your application profile, our faculty/leader will provide an assessment which will be fully reviewed by the Admissions Selection Committee, who will make the final decision on your admission placement and/or scholarship.
