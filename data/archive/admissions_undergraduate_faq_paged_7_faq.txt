--------------
Will SUTD grant credit transfer/ waiver and/ or exemption of modules for polytechnic students/ students transferring from other universities?

No, due to the unique structure and rigour of the SUTD curriculum, all students will need to enrol in and go through the same programme in the freshman year and first term of the sophomore year (Freshmore) before choosing a major thereafter. SUTD does not grant any exemption of modules, unless you have taken the SUTD course previously under a special arrangement.
--------------
What are the research opportunities available in SUTD for undergraduates?

All undergraduates are welcome to participate in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (UROP), where you can explore your research interests and participate in different phases of standard research activity. Students can either initiate research projects or apply for faculty-led projects. Successful UROP proposals will be supported with $1,500 in funding for consumables and materials according to prevailing UROP funding guidelines. You may refer to the
UROP webpage
for more information.
Alternatively, students who aspire to pursue a research-related career may consider applying for the
SUTD Honours and Research Programme (SHARP)
at the point of admission.
--------------
How are students assessed?

The grading may be based on a combination of homework, design projects (1D, 2D), class participation/activity, online quizzes, mid-term tests and final exams, with the weightages varying for different subjects.
Students are graded on a GPA of 5.0. To help ease your transition to the university, all four subjects taken in the first Freshmore term are not graded. From the 2019 cohort onwards, students can also choose an additional two subjects from Freshmore terms 2 and 3 to be ungraded.
--------------
Are all students allowed to take a minor in SUTD and what are the requirements?

Currently, students taking up either CSD (formerly ISTD), DAI, EPD or ESD will be able to pursue a minor on top of their major, potentially without having to overload on the number of modules (this depends on the specialisation chosen, if any). You will get to indicate your preferred minor after you have made your choice of major at the end of Term 3. Both the major and minor requirements must be completed within the normal candidature of the undergraduate programme, i.e. 8 terms.

minors can be found here

Is there any financial aid for students who are unable to afford the housing fees?

There are various options to finance your housing fees:
Singapore Citizens may choose to utilise funds from their Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) to pay for their housing fees in the first 2 academic terms of their Freshmore year.
All students can apply for a Study Loan from DBS bank which provides an allowance that can be used to pay for the housing fees, provided they are already under a Tuition Fee Loan or the CPF Education Loan Scheme, or receiving the Mendaki Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy.
For more information, please refer to the
Financing Options
page.

How are students assigned to their rooms? What if I am not comfortable with my assigned roommate?

Freshmore students are paired in double rooms according to the class/cluster they are assigned to. Students complete a lifestyle questionnaire as part of the housing acceptance process, and will be matched with roommates of similar lifestyle habits as far as possible.
As both you and your roommate embark on your university journey, with time you will discover each other’s interests, strengths and quirks, as well as how to support and cheer each other on in this new environment. Do approach the Office of Housing at
ecchousing@sutd.edu.sg
should you need our help to resolve any differences.
--------------
Is it compulsory to stay in the student hostel? Is there a curfew?

Yes, Freshmores are required to reside at the hostel during Terms 1 and 2 including those who live near the campus, as residential living is an integrated part of the SUTD Freshmore experience, complementing the cohort-based learning in and out of classrooms.
While there is no curfew and students are free to return home or go out to attend to personal matters, students are expected to observe stipulated quiet hours to minimise disturbance to fellow residents.
