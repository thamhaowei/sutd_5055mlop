What should I submit for my personal portfolio? What does SUTD look out for?

Your personal portfolio should demonstrate your relevant attributes and showcase accomplishments in your interest areas, such as (though not exhaustive): completing external courses in your area of interest (e.g. programming), participating and winning external competitions (e.g. hackathons, IT bug bounty hunt, etc.), personal achievements (coding your own app to solve a problem, starting your own business venture, etc.) or even how you succeeded against all odds in the face of adversity. Through these, we hope to gain a better understanding of you as an individual, and assess if you have the traits to flourish in SUTD.

What are the Mother Tongue Language (MTL) requirements for Singapore Citizens (SC)/Permanent Residents (SPR) presenting international qualifications?

All SCs and SPRs
are required to fulfil the MTL requirement for admission into full-time publicly-funded undergraduate programmes in the local Autonomous Universities (AUs).
You may apply for admission with no prejudice to your application even if you have not fulfilled the MTL requirement, but will be required to fulfil the MTL requirement during your course of study if accepted into the programme.

What are your admission requirements/ cut-off points for the undergraduate degree programmes?

SUTD practises a common admission selection regardless of your programme interest, as all SUTD students will be taking

We consider all applications comprehensively, taking into account your academic preparedness as well as your traits, qualities, passion and aspiration for fit with SUTD. For the former, students with strong competency in Mathematics and the Sciences (specifically Physics or Chemistry) are generally preferred. For the latter, through your participation in co-curricular activities, accomplishments, teacher’s recommendations, and responses to our personal insight questions, we hope to gain a better understanding of you as an individual, and if you have the attributes to flourish in SUTD. All shortlisted candidates will also be invited to an interview – so we can get to know you beyond what your online application is telling us.
